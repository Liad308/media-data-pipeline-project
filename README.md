# Media Data Analytics Pipeline

A distributed data analysis pipeline for understanding TV viewing behavior based on demographic clustering.  
Built using PySpark, MLlib, and Kafka as part of a Distributed Databases Management course project at the Technion.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project processes demographic and viewing datasets to:
- Normalize and encode user features
- Cluster households using PCA and KMeans
- Analyze preferred TV stations per cluster
- Compare viewing behavior in static vs. streaming scenarios

## 🛠 Technologies
- PySpark
- MLlib (PCA, Clustering)
- Kafka (simulated streaming)
- matplotlib for visualization

## 📁 Structure
- `notebooks/` – Full notebook with code & results
